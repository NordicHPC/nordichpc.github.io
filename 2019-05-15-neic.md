title: Reimagining Research Computing workshop, NeIC2019 - NordicHPC
---

At the Neic2019 conference](https://indico.neic.no/event/18/), we
hosted a workshop titled [Reimagining Research
Computing](https://indico.neic.no/event/18/contributions/170/).  This
workshop was in fact the founding moment of NordicHPC.  (For the
"Jupyter for research facilities" meeting nodes, see
[jupyter](jupyter.html).

The abstract can be found at the link above, but it short we had the
realization that clusters are not keeping up with the times: they are
still, for the most part, managed like decades ago.  These days,
standards for usability are much higher and our audience of users has
changed a lot.  At the same time, we could do much better with modern
software and tools.

This page gives the main lessons from the workshop with some possible
actions.



## Reimagined HPC

First, what do we mean by HPC?: Traditional ssh-access Linux clusters
with a scheduling system.  There are simpler special-purpose computing
platforms, but we are focused on more general-purpose infrastructure
(there will always be need for this).  We also aren't exactly talking
about new systems where users get private virtual machines clusters -
these are important, but there will still be some need for large-scale
scheduled infrastructure (and efficiently using these virtual clusters
can be an even harder development challenge!).

Like it or not, the Linux cluster isn't going away anytime soon and
will continue to be the workhorse for people that need computing and
can't develop for more specialized platforms.  Yet, these clusters are
not evolving with the times.  This has to change.

Thus, *reimagined HPC is improving Linux clusters so that they are
usable by more people*.  This is just one small portion of "research
computing", but still important, and something that not many think
about from the start.  Most attempts to improve clusters are small
changes, but we think that we need to *reimagine* from the beginning
while still focusing on Linux clusters.

The POSIX Linux interface is still standard, so needs good support.
We want it to be easy to use this, but not to remove everything.
Increased consumer usability can make the learning curve steeper.  We
need to make the learning curve more gradual again, while still having
the possibility to end at the same place.

Just think how much more usable desktop Linux is compared to 10 or 20
years ago.  Why haven't clusters made the same strides?



## Papercuts

A "papercut" is a usability term for a small problem which causes
great pain for users, yet which seems easily solveable.  Since HPC
systems still operate mostly as designed long ago, there are many
papercuts in them.  One primary outcome of the workshop was cataloging
what the most common papercuts are and how they could be resolved.

### Organizational
* Problem: **Buy big resources first, usability later**.  Other companies make something usable first, scale later.  Usability and staff is rarely a primary concern.
* ???
* Problem: **Centralization = less user interaction**
* Problem: **Sysadmin hiring** - your ideal sysadmin is already a Linux expert and doesn't represent most users.
* Problem: **Bad project management**.
* Problem: **Bad bureaucracy**
* Problem: **Bad decision-making**
* Idea: **Documentation-driven development**.  Make clear, sensible instructions first then implement it.
* Idea: **Standardization as a goal**.  Sites are almost gratuitously different.


### Accounts/access

* Idea: **Better authentication/authorization delegation**.
