title: Reimagining Research Computing workshop, NeIC2019
---

At the Neic2019 conference](https://indico.neic.no/event/18/), we
hosted a workshop titled [Reimagining Research
Computing](https://indico.neic.no/event/18/contributions/170/).  This
workshop was in fact the founding moment of NordicHPC.

The abstract can be found at the link above, but it short we had the
realization that clusters are not keeping up with the times: they are
still, for the most part, managed like decades ago.  These days,
standards for usability are much higher and our audience of users has
changed a lot.  At the same time, we could do much better with modern
software and tools.
