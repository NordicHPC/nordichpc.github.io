# NordicHPC Github repository

NordicHPC has a [Github organization](https://github.com/NordicHPC/)
which is used for co-maintains of useful code and other material.  We
don't yet entirely know how this works yet, but this is our general
idea.

In theory, there is no benefit to hosting code here rather than on an
institutional page.  Still, there are some benefits: We'd always
recommend NordicHPC over using a personal Github account, because it
provides a way for code to be inherited and maintained over a longer
period of time (yes, we realize that personal Github accounts are like
a CV now, it's unfortunate that this is at conflict with group
maintenance).  There is less benefit of NordicHPC compared to other
institutional Github organizations, but this provides better
visibility, more eyes, and more users.



## General principles

- Scripts should be open source sufficiently so that others can use.

- We presume that each code will have some primary maintainers.
  However, we recognize that people come and go, so recommend that we
  wait a short time for the main maintainers to accept a pull request,
  then some time for others with knowledge to accept a pull request,
  and then anyone else is assumed to be welcome to accept pull
  requests.  Those that accept a PR should be aware enough to see
  follow-up and help with any problems that may come up afterwards!

- The README should indicate any particular notes related to
  maintenance.

- Things maintained here don't have to be perfect, well maintained, or
  ready for general use.  Just document the general maturity level,
  and of course if there's not much documentation it will be assumed
  that it's not very mature.  Try to include at least a basic README.



## Who?

We are called "**Nordic** HPC" but we realize we shouldn't exclude
others.  Still, we have started as a local community.  We will at
least add as members anyone working at an academic computing center
who chooses to be a part of NordicHPC.

Come to our meetings to help decide how our membership will work.



## Suggestions for readme files

Readme files should list:

- Site which has done primary development, key maintainers (not just
  to help management, it's important to give credit when it is due).

- Any requests on other members accepting pull requests.
