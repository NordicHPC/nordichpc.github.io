# NordicHPC

We are a loose collaboration of computing facility staff and
friends. Most of us are somewhere between application experts or
sysadmins of clusters, those who are the front line of supporting
research and deal with all of the daily mess. We have a special
focuses on usability and reimagining HPC for the modern age, loose
collaboration of development, and networking within users and staff.

This explicitly includes those providing newer types of systems which
allow different types of access (more usable, for example) to
large-scale computing resources.  We don't provide or pool resources,
but serve as a collaboration platform to develop existing
resources.

We are based in the Nordic area, but inclusive to others.  *Every site
that is involved in HPC center in the Nordics should take part.*


## Goals

Share solutions and problems across centers and across countries.
Collaborative maintenance of said solutions.

Improve the usability of HPC and large research computing systems for
the modern world.

We would like to meet 1-2/year in an informal setting where we share recipes
and issues with the hope of improving the user experience but also the
"sysadmin experience".


## Meetings

Next: [Helsinki, November 14-15](/2019-11-14-helsinki/).

In general, including past events: [meetings](/meetings/)

2-day meetings (lunch-lunch) in an easy to access city, once or twice
a year.  Please contact radovan.bast@uit.no if you would like to be
informed about such events.


## NordicHPC github repository

We create a huge number of small, one-use scripts and larger
projects as part of their daily work.  Why not share them?  The
[NordicHPC github organization](https://github.com/NordicHPC) provides
a way to do that.  It can give your work more visibility, and shared
maintnance can produce better software for all of us.

See the [repository information](/repo/) for more information.


## Contact

* Mailing list: coming, for announcements and discussion of projects.
* Chat with us on our [Zulip chat
  channel](https://coderefinery.zulipchat.com/) - sign up and join the
  NordicHPC stream.  Currently it is shared with the [CodeRefinery
  project](https://coderefinery.org) due to overlap but may move
  sometime else later.  For detailed discussions and organizational
  planning.
