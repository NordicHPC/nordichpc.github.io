# NordicHPC

Collaboration of Nordic HPC sysadmins, with a broad definition of HPC.


## Goals

Share solutions and problems across centers and across countries.

We would like to meet 1-2/year in an informal setting where we share recipes
and issues with the hope of improving the user experience but also the
"sysadmin experience".


## Next meet-up

2-day meeting (lunch-lunch), probably Stockholm or Helsinki area, probably autumn 2019 or spring 2020.
Please contact radovan.bast@uit.no if you would like to be informed about such events.


## Sharing of scripts/recipes

Would you like to share a nifty script or solution with others via
[https://github.com/nordichpc](https://github.com/nordichpc)? Yes please!
