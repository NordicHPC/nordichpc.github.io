# NordicHPC

Collaboration of Nordic HPC sysadmins, with a broad definition of
HPC. This explicitly includes those providing newer types of systems
which allow different types of access (more usable, for example) to
large-scale computing resources.

We are based in the Nordic area, but inclusive to others.

## Goals

Share solutions and problems across centers and across countries.
Collaborative maintenance of said solutions.

Improve the usability of HPC and large research computing systems for
the modern world.

We would like to meet 1-2/year in an informal setting where we share recipes
and issues with the hope of improving the user experience but also the
"sysadmin experience".


## Next meet-up

2-day meeting (lunch-lunch), probably Stockholm or Helsinki area, probably autumn 2019 or spring 2020.
Please contact radovan.bast@uit.no if you would like to be informed about such events.


## Sharing of scripts/recipes

Would you like to share a nifty script or solution with others via
[https://github.com/NordicHPC](https://github.com/NordicHPC)? Yes please!
