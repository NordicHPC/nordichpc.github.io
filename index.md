# NordicHPC

NordicHPC is a collaboration of Nordic HPC sysadmins, with a broad
definition of HPC. This explicitly includes those providing newer
types of systems which allow different types of access (more usable,
for example) to large-scale computing resources.  We don't provide
resources, but serve as a collaboration platform to develop existing
resources.  We have a special focus on usability.

We are based in the Nordic area, but inclusive to others.



## Goals

Share solutions and problems across centers and across countries.
Collaborative maintenance of said solutions.

Improve the usability of HPC and large research computing systems for
the modern world.

We would like to meet 1-2/year in an informal setting where we share recipes
and issues with the hope of improving the user experience but also the
"sysadmin experience".



## Meetings

Next: [Helsinki, November 14-15](2019-11-14-helsinki).

In general: [meetings](meetings.html)

2-day meetings (lunch-lunch) in an easy to access city, once or twice
a year.  Please contact radovan.bast@uit.no if you would like to be
informed about such events.






## NordicHPC github repository

Sysadmins create a huge amount of small, one-use scripts and larger
projects as part of their daily work.  Why not share them?  The
[NordicHPC github organization](https://github.com/NordicHPC) provides
a way to do that.  It can give your work more visibility, and shared
maintnance can produce better software for all of us.

See the [repository information](repo.html) for more information.
