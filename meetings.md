# NordicHPC meetings

## About

NordicHPC meetings are a time for staff of Nordic computing centers to
meet up and exchange best practices and tips, and work on joint
software that helps everyone.  Computing centers tend
to be quite independent and conservative, but we all have the same
problems.  Why not work on solutions together?

## Next meeting

2-day meeting (lunch-lunch), probably Stockholm or Helsinki area,
probably autumn 2019 or spring 2020. Please contact
radovan.bast@uit.no if you would like to be informed about such
events.

## Schedule

The general idea is:
- Most of half-day 1: each attendee presents 5-10 cool things that happen
  at their site, and 5-10 common problems they have.  This allows us
  to network and look for problem-solution pairs.
- Most of half-day 2: collaborative working together in an
  unconference-type format, based on lessons of the first half.
- Discussion of collaboration models.
