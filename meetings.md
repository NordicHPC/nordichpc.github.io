# NordicHPC meetings

## About

NordicHPC meetings are a time for staff of Nordic computing centers to
meet up and exchange best practices and tips.

## Next meeting

2-day meeting (lunch-lunch), probably Stockholm or Helsinki area,
probably autumn 2019 or spring 2020. Please contact
radovan.bast@uit.no if you would like to be informed about such
events.

## Schedule

The general idea is:
- Most of half-day 1: each attendee presents 5-10 cool things that happen
  at their site, and 5-10 common problems they have.  This allows us
  to network and look for problem-solution pairs.
- Most of half-day 2: collaborative working together in an
  unconference-type format.
- Discussion of collaboration models.
