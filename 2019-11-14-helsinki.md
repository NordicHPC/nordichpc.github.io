# NordicHPC 2019: Helsinki, 14-15 November

Computing facilities tend to all have the same problems, but every
site tends to have its own solutions.  Big collaborations tend to be
about big hardware or policies, and not so much the day to day
difficulties that we face.  The Nordics already have a special
connection and are a good size to make a grassroots community of
admins and support staff working together.

NordicHPC is a group of like-minded individuals in the Nordics who
want to work together to make our resources more usable and better
maintained (or even just to make the maintenance easier).  Despite the
name, our focus is *not only* traditional HPC, but we do tend focus on
basic computing infrastructure, not platforms for a specific purpose.

We have a special focus on *usability*, and a vision to match.

We have a preliminary program scheduled, but the actual program is
organized in collaboration with all attendees.  We also hope the most
important outcome is networking and come out of spontaneous
discussions.  We'll use an "unconference"-type format for most of the
workshop.  Come prepared to collaborate - this is a meeting for the
doers.

## Registration

You can [register here](https://forms.gle/u9VLEcoWcSbWkgpk9)
for attendance, possible attendance, or remote attendance.  **Our
first meeting is a small, intimate event with limited space, please
register early.**  (2019-10-24: there is still some space).

The ideal attendee is working in developing, maintaining, or supporting
general-purpose computing infrastructure in the Nordics, and has an
ability to take ideas into practice on their systems.  Other users or interested parties
are welcome as well.  We'll try to make room for anyone in academic
computing centers in the Nordics.

Attendee announcements are mirrored to [this github
issue](https://github.com/NordicHPC/nordichpc.github.io/issues/36).

### Session descriptions

We have the following invited/pre-planned sessions, the other offers
can be found [in the
scratchpad](https://hackmd.io/uCFgSqABSBKP1PGKLxjLKQ?both):

**Cool things and problems**: Each site presents around three cool
things that their site does, and three problems they have.  This
becomes a discussion on shared opportunities.  Please come prepared
with something to present and add to [the
slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1zXVxqLQ9E8AEtexIKWWt7AjwmrKLt9HpJCvIGcv7-nQ).
Organizer: Radovan Bast

**Computing, Usability, and HPC**, Marko Nieminen, Professor, Aalto
University.

**Lightning talks**: Anyone who wants to give a lightning talk, let us
know.  There's no topic too small, especially consider talks on small
problems, solutions, or UI problems you have.



### Requested sessions

See the [Agenda scratchpad](https://hackmd.io/uCFgSqABSBKP1PGKLxjLKQ?both).





## Location

Aalto University campus (Otaniemi), Finland. [Computer Science
building room T4](https://usefulaaltomap.fi/#!/select/T4).  Address:
Konemiehentie 2, Espoo.  It's on the second floor, reachable from the
main atrium.  The building is normally called "the computer science
building" if you ask someone for help.  Once you get to the building,
just ask anyone for "T4" and they can direct you there.





## Arrival and practicalities

This is an unfunded event, so each participant is responsible for
their own costs but there is also no registration fee.  A lunch the
first day and coffee is provided.

Hotels: there is a Radison Blu in Otaniemi which is a common choice,
an easy 10 minute walk.  Downtown Helsinki or Espoo hotels are a
reasonable choice if close to the metro.

Transportation: from the airport, take the train to the central train
station (last stop), then metro to the stop "Aalto University", then
take the B exit.  A single ABC ticket (4.60€) covers *all*
transportation, buy on the train platform at the ticket machines.
From Otaniemi to downtown, an AB ticket (2.80€) works.
[Reittiopas](https://reittiopas.fi) is the journey planner and there
is also a [HSL app](https://www.hsl.fi/en/app) that lets you buy
mobile tickets and check routes.

From the airport, plan on 75-90 minutes gate-to-door to get to
Otaniemi.  Plan on leaving Otaniemi two hours in advance of your
flight.  From the train station, plan for are 20-30 minutes and
30 minutes to get back.

We have a [full picture guide of the from metro to train station to
the venue](https://imgur.com/a/ayTid7g).

Taxi: say "Aalto University in Otaniemi, address Konemiehentie 2".
Construction makes the traffic really bad, so we'd recommend you get
close enough then get off and walk.
